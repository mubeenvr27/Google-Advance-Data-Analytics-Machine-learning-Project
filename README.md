# Capstone Project - Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate

# Project Overview
This repository contains the final capstone project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate program. The project simulates real-world data analytics work, where I took on the role of a data specialist at a fictional company, Salifort Motors, tasked with improving employee retention using data-driven insights.

# Scenario
Salifort Motors is a French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer with a global workforce of over 100,000 employees. The company's senior leadership team has provided survey data and tasked me with analyzing this data to create strategies for increasing employee retention. The goal was to design a predictive model to identify whether an employee would leave the company based on variables like department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and other key factors.

# Key Objectives
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigate the dataset to identify patterns and insights.
Model Building: Develop predictive models to forecast employee turnover using both statistical and machine learning techniques.
Stakeholder Presentation: Provide actionable insights and recommendations to Salifort Motors' leadership team through an executive summary.

# Skills Demonstrated
Data Analysis: Analyzing and cleaning data using Python (Pandas, NumPy, etc.)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Model Building: Implementing logistic regression and tree-based machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest).
Ethical Considerations: Ensuring ethical practices in data handling and analysis.

Communication: Summarizing insights and presenting results to stakeholders.

#bRepository Contents
EDA.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis performed on the dataset.
Model_Building.ipynb: A notebook demonstrating the process of building predictive models using both logistic regression and tree-based machine learning algorithms.
Executive_Summary.pdf: A report summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations for improving employee retention.
data/ The dataset used for the analysis (if available publicly).

# How to Use This Repository
